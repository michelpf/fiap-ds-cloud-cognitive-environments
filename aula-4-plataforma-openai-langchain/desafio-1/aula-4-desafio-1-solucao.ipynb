Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.\\nSummary::\\nAIM: Amyloid A amyloidosis is a rare complication of chronic inflammatory conditions. Most patients with amyloid A amyloidosis present with nephropathy and it leads to renal failure and death. We studied clinical characteristics and survival in patients with amyloid A amyloidosis.\\nMETHODS: A total of 81 patients (51 males, 30 females) with renal biopsy proven amyloid A amyloidosis were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into good and poor outcomes groups according to survival results.\\nRESULTS: Most of the patients (55.6%) had nephrotic range proteinuria at diagnosis. Most frequent underlying disorders were familial Mediterranean fever (21.2%) and rheumatoid arthritis (10.6%) in the good outcome group and malignancy (20%) in the poor outcome group. Only diastolic blood pressure in the good outcome group and phosphorus level in the poor outcome group was higher. Serum creatinine levels increased after treatment in both groups, while proteinuria in the good outcome group decreased. Increase in serum creatinine and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of the poor outcome group were more significant in the good outcome group. At the time of diagnosis 18.5% and 27.2% of all patients had advanced chronic kidney disease (stage 4 and 5, respectively). Median duration of renal survival was 65±3.54 months. Among all patients, 27.1% were started dialysis treatment during the follow-up period and 7.4% of all patients underwent kidney transplantation. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure [hazard ratios 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1-1.06, p=0.036], serum creatinine (hazard ratios 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.46, p=0.006) and urinary protein excretion (hazard ratios 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.16, p=0.027) were predictors of end-stage renal disease.

            "OBJECTIVES: Ophthalmologic involvement in monogenic autoinflammatory diseases has been explored mainly in paediatric patients. The aim of this study is to characterise ophthalmologic manifestations, therapeutic management and visual outcomes in a Spanish (UVESAI) cohort of adult/paediatric patients with monogenic autoinflammatory diseases.\n",
            "METHODS: Multicentre and retrospective study of patients with monogenic autoinflammatory diseases and ocular involvement. Eye manifestations, structural complications, treatments used and visual outcomes were analysed, and compared with previous studies.\n",
            "RESULTS: Forty-six patients (44/2 adults/children; 21/25 adult/paediatric-onset) with monogenic autoinflammatory diseases [cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (n=13/28.3%), mainly Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) (n=11/24%); familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (n=12/26%); TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS); (n=9/20%); Blau syndrome (n=8/17%); hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) (n=2/4.3%), deficiency of adenosine deaminase-2 and NLRC4-Autoinflammatory disease] (one each) were included. Conjunctivitis (n=26/56.5%) and uveitis (n=23/50%) were the most frequent ocular manifestations. Twelve (26.1%) patients developed structural complications, being cataracts (n=11/24%) and posterior synechiae (n=10/22%) the most frequent. Conjunctivitis predominated in TRAPS, FMF, MWS and HIDS (mainly in adults), and uveitis, in Blau syndrome. Seven (8%) eyes (all with uveitis) presented with impaired visual acuity. Local and systemic treatment led to good visual outcomes in most patients. Compared with previous studies mainly including paediatric patients, less severe ocular involvement was observed in our adult/paediatric cohort.\n",
            "CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctivitis was the most common ocular man\u001b[0m\n",

The study found that conjunctivitis and uveitis were the most frequent ocular manifestations in these patients, and treatment led to good visual outcomes in most cases. Compared to previous studies mainly including pediatric patients, the ocular involvement in this cohort was less severe.\n",
