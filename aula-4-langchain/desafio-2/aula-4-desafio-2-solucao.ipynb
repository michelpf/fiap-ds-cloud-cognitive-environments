Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.\\nSummary::\\nAIM: Amyloid A amyloidosis is a rare complication of chronic inflammatory conditions. Most patients with amyloid A amyloidosis present with nephropathy and it leads to renal failure and death. We studied clinical characteristics and survival in patients with amyloid A amyloidosis.\\nMETHODS: A total of 81 patients (51 males, 30 females) with renal biopsy proven amyloid A amyloidosis were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into good and poor outcomes groups according to survival results.\\nRESULTS: Most of the patients (55.6%) had nephrotic range proteinuria at diagnosis. Most frequent underlying disorders were familial Mediterranean fever (21.2%) and rheumatoid arthritis (10.6%) in the good outcome group and malignancy (20%) in the poor outcome group. Only diastolic blood pressure in the good outcome group and phosphorus level in the poor outcome group was higher. Serum creatinine levels increased after treatment in both groups, while proteinuria in the good outcome group decreased. Increase in serum creatinine and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of the poor outcome group were more significant in the good outcome group. At the time of diagnosis 18.5% and 27.2% of all patients had advanced chronic kidney disease (stage 4 and 5, respectively). Median duration of renal survival was 65±3.54 months. Among all patients, 27.1% were started dialysis treatment during the follow-up period and 7.4% of all patients underwent kidney transplantation. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure [hazard ratios 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 1-1.06, p=0.036], serum creatinine (hazard ratios 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.46, p=0.006) and urinary protein excretion (hazard ratios 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.16, p=0.027) were predictors of end-stage renal disease.

            "Colchicine, a natural compound extracted from Colchicum autumnale, is a phytotoxin, but interestingly, it also has multiple pharmacological activities. Clinically, colchicine is widely used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, cardiovascular dysfunction and new coronary pneumonia. However, overdose intake of colchicine could cause lethal liver damage, which is a limitation of its application. Therefore, exploring the potential mechanism of colchicine-induced hepatotoxicity is meaningful. Interestingly, it was found that CYP1A1 played an important role in the hepatotoxicity of colchicine, while it might also participate in its metabolism. Inhibition of CYP1A1 could alleviate oxidative stress and pyroptosis in the liver upon colchicine treatment. By regulating CYP1A1 through the CASPASE-1-GSDMD pathway, colchicine-induced liver injury was effectively relieved in a mouse model. In summary, we concluded that CYP1A1 may be a potential target, and the inhibition of CYP1A1 alleviates colchicine-induced liver injury through pyroptosis regulated by the CASPASE-1-GSDMD pathway.\n",

Colchicine is the primary treatment for FMF, although some patients do not respond well or are unable to tolerate it. For these patients, the addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists is the preferred option. However, the impact of colchicine treatment alongside the use of IL-1 antagonists remains unclear.\n",
